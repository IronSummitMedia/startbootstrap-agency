                                We brought Adam on board as our Chief Architect to assist with the planning and execution of major structural changes.<br><br>

                        His work helped us improve the performance of our bioinformacs SaaS, lowering computation time and cost by around 40%.<br><br>

                        Adam's Architecture diagrams and process analysis documents helped our sales team streamline the technical sales process by making it easier to inform prospective clients about our architecture and the security measures we have taken (and will be taking in the future), as part of that process he had also ensured our company would comply with GDPR, HIPAA and SOC2 type 2, worked with suppliers and auditors and joined client meetings to plan for future demands, effecvely operang as acting CISO.<br><br>

                        We are sad to see Adam go, and would wish him good luck in his future endeavors.

                        His fields of expertise revolve around architecture and performance of large-scale software solutions, but I’ve seen him successfully apply similar principles from low-level timer latencies to web development. I’ve had the privilege of working with him on several technical projects, both as a technical owner and as an extra hand, and I hold his skills, both in facing customers and in facing technical challages, in high regard."
